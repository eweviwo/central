# How to contribute to the project?

Akpe ka ka ka! (Thanks a lot) for getting to this step.

This is where things get technical but be rest assured about your personal capability to contribute in any way. If you are new to the concept of open source development and methodologies, we kindly encourage you to spend some time with some resources provided in this [link](https://intelligent-olive-8dc.notion.site/Open-Source-Introduction-4460855a4bc14383ba0a1b990746335d?pvs=4). It will give you a surface guide on what you are to expect from this community's way of doing things.

If you are already familiar with open source development, you can move on to read about the rest of the contributing guidelines. Please be informed about how every part works to enable you pick a particular section you are comfortable and challenged about. Yes, it is possible for an individual to work on more than one section but kindly know each section demands a different approach. 

# Understanding the BAG

BAG stands for Big Architecture Graphic in our community development. It is a single visual that shows how the different sections of the project come together. We encourage contributors to understand this repo and the Changelog first before moving to other parts. One can access the BAG repo through [here](https://github.com/eweviwo/BAG). 

# Mobile App Development

The central repository (current one you are viewing) contains the source code for the mobile app. You are welcome to download them (clone) and work on desirable features or fix bugs then request to merge it with the main source code. The tech stack used here is [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/).

# Research Development

Research is developed in this [repo](https://github.com/eweviwo/research). Our research is abstracted into a single a notepad file for now. Producers and presenters will use this file as their reference points for content development. We welome diverse researchers and enthusiasts to contribute to it.

# Applications (for Producers & Presenters)

This section contains our approach to accepting and vetting interest to make a podcast episode from anyone. There are application links for interested producers and presenters in this repo. The application process is open to improvement so we have provided a set of instructions towards how to do it. The repo is available [here](https://github.com/eweviwo/applications).

# Production System Development 

There will be a production system to bring together producers, presenters and editors to work together. The production system will be an application for specific collaboration and not a media editing tool. Development of the application will take place in its own repo. You can visit the repo by clicking on this [link](https://github.com/eweviwo/system).

# Content Delivery Network Development

The project will like to work on its own CDN at some point. This will serve our applications with text articles, graphics, audio and video media files according to the BAG description. There is no functional and non-functional requirements for it currently. It is also the only repo with no other file aside its READ ME. Once can access the repo [here](https://github.com/eweviwo/cdn). 

# Other Developments

If there is any particular area for the project's development you want to undertake and not sectioned in any of the above areas we have discussed, we encourage you to reach out to us on our [X page (formerly Twitter)](https://twitter.com/eweviwo). Our DMs are open. We are working on improving more communication options in the future.

# Our Changelog Document

It is the project's goal to present an informing snapshot of the latest updates of the project in one document. This document will guide the overall versioning of the project. Only maintainers will direct its update. Only the central repository will contain the Changelog document.

# How to contribute to the project?

Akpe ka ka ka! (Thanks a lot) for getting to this step.

This is where things get technical but be rest assured about your personal capability to contribute in any way. If you are new to the concept of open source development and methodologies, we kindly encourage you to spend some time with some resources provided in this [link](https://intelligent-olive-8dc.notion.site/Open-Source-Introduction-4460855a4bc14383ba0a1b990746335d?pvs=4). It will give you a surface guide on what you are to expect from this community's way of doing things.

If you are already familiar with open source development, you can move on to read about the rest of the contributing guidelines. Please be informed about how every part works to enable you pick a particular section you are comfortable and challenged about. Yes, it is possible for an individual to work on more than one section but kindly know each section demands a different approach. 

# Understanding the BAG

BAG stands for Big Architecture Graphic in our community development. It is a single visual that shows how the different sections of the project come together. The BAG defines the contribution constructs of the work of this community. The file is hosted on [Figma]() but has its dedicated repoitory [here](). It is open to change so anyone can raise an issue or PR about it. 

# Mobile App Development

The central repository (current one you are viewing) contains the source code for the mobile app. You are welcome to download them (clone) and work on desirable features or fix bugs then request to merge it with the main source code. The tech stack used here is [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/).

# Research Development

Research is developed in this [repo](). Our research is abstracted in a notepad file by using some of the conventions of [Backusâ€“Naur form grammar](). The research will outlay the focus points or thematic areas for our podcasts or discussions. Producers and presenters will use this file as their reference points for intellectual development of content. It is open to input and anyone can raise an issue or PR about it.

# Applications (for Producers & Presenters)

This section contains our aproach to accepting and vetting interest to make a podcast episode from anyone. There is an application link for [Producers]() and [Presenters](). Kindly click on a choice of your application. The application process is open to improvement so we have provided a set of notepad files to invite anyone who can improve the process by submitting an issue or PR also. The repo is available [here]().

# Production System Development 

There will be a production system to bring together producers, presenters and editors to collaborate. Accepted applications from producers and presenters will have access to the production system. Editors will be sent an invite by producers. Currently, there is no source code for it except a set of functional and non-functional requirements for its development in a notepd file. You can visit the repo by clicking on this [link]().

# Content Delivery Network Development

The project wishes to work on its own CDN at some point. This will serve our applications with text articles, graphics, audio and video media files as the BAG shows. There is no source code for it. There is also no functional and non-functional requirements for it now. Currently the only repo with no file aside its READ ME. Once can access the repo [here](). 

# Other Developments

If there is any paticular spot for development you want to undertake and not sectioned in any of the above, we encourage you to reach out to us on our [Twitter or X page](https://twitter.com/eweviwo). Our DMs are open. Please use our Twitter DMs as your primary messaging option for now as we are working on improving more communication options in the future.

# Our Changelog Document

As much as we are making it faster for anyone to get started on any part of the project, we also want to make it easy for anyone to get a snapshot of the features of the total project at any point in time. There will be a changelog driven release document to inform anyone of this snapshot. Maintainers will direct the semantic versioning. Its file will be stored in the central repo.
